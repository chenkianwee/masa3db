# Import CityGML
## Official Method (Not Working)
1. Download the [3D City Database Importer/Exporter](https://www.3dcitydb.org/3dcitydb/d3dimpexp/)

    a. You will need to install Java for the installer to work. Install Java [here](https://java.com/en/download/)

2. Once installed you will need to connect to the database. (However it cannot connect to a PostgreSQL database through a SSL connection.) This method is currently not working.

    ```{figure} /_static/045import_citygml/3dcitydb_connect.png
    :scale: 60%
    :name: 3dcitydb_connect

    There are no SSL connection settings.
    ```
3. You can still use the software to validate your CityGML file.
    ```{figure} /_static/045import_citygml/3dcitydb_import.png
    :scale: 60%
    :name: 3dcitydb_import

## Workaround
### Under Development ... ...
[Possible workaround that has not been implemented](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/70#issuecomment-710457603)

## SQL for 3DCityDB
1. Show the names and height of the building.
    ```
    select c.name,c.id,b.measured_height from cityobject c inner join building b on b.id = c.id ;
    ```
2. To check the geometry of the buildings.
    ```
    select ST_AsGML(geometry) from surface_geometry where id=5;
    ```
